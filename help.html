  <h1>Tiny RPN</h1>

  <p>Tiny RPN is a <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation">Reverse
  Polish Notation</a> calculator, operated entirely with the keyboard.
  It displays the contents of the stack as you modify it (WYSIWYC â€”
  What You See Is What You Calculate :-)).</p>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>To enter several numbers, separate them with spaces or commas, or
      press Enter/Return after each one. Negative numbers can be entered by
      using a leading underscore.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>To perform an arithmetic operation, type its character (e.g. + for
      addition) in the entry box; instead of displaying the character, the
      stack will be updated. The arithmetic operations are:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><code>+ - * + / % ~ ^ &amp; | \</code></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>(<code>^</code> is exponentiation, because most people expect it
      there, so xor is moved to <code>\</code>. <code>~</code> is unary
      negation.)</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>To perform a named operation, type in its name followed by a
      space/comma/enter. Named commands are:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><code>and or not pop drop drop2 swap dup dup2 clear noop</code></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>plus these standard (to JavaScript, anyway) math functions:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><code>abs acos asin atan atan2 ceil cos exp floor log max min pow
        random round sin sqrt tan</code></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>and these constants:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><code>E LN2 LN10 LOG2E LOG10E PI SQRT1_2 SQRT2</code></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>(Also, at the moment, <code>;</code> is an alias
      for <code>swap</code>. All such shortcut keys will be subject to
      change until I get some consensus from users on what is
      sensible.)</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Numbers can also be popped by pressing the Backspace key when the
      entry box is empty. If you use this method or
      <code>pop</code>, the number on the top of the stack will be
      returned to the entry box so you can edit it.
      <code>drop</code> will remove the number on top of the
      stack without doing this.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>The popup can be closed with the Esc key (this is true of all
      browser action popups, but I didn't realize it until I wrote one
      that involved typing).</p>
  </ul>

  <h2>Plans for Future Versions</h2>
  <p>Is Tiny RPN not adequate for you yet? Here's what I have planned
  and would love help with. <a href="http://github.com/decklin/tiny-rpn">Fork
  me on Github!</a></p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>Animated visual feedback</p></li>
    <li><p>Undo</p></li>
    <li><p>Non-float modes (at least money)</p></li>
    <li><p>Remove anything that would gratuitously surprise an HP user</p></li>
    <li><p>Programmability</p></li>
    <li><p>Hooks to open web sites (e.g. Google currency conversion)</p></li>
  </ul>
